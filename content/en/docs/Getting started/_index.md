## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisite:

- **Uganda Data Project Account:** Visit [uganda.risidev.com.shop](https://uganda.risidev.com) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.

1. Log in to your Uganda Data Project account at [uganda.risidev.com.shop](https://uganda.risidev.com).
2. Navigate to your profile settings.
3. Under the "API Keys" section, generate an API key. Keep this key secure.

## Accessing Data Through API

Now that you have an API key, you can access data through the Uganda Data Project API:

1. Use the API key in your requests to authenticate and access the API endpoints.
2. Explore the available datasets related to districts, counties, sub-counties, parishes, and villages in Uganda.
3. Follow the API documentation for details on endpoints, parameters, and response formats.

## Try it out!

Now that you are set up with an API key, you can start accessing data programmatically:

1. Use tools like cURL, Postman, or your preferred programming language to make API requests.
2. Retrieve data on districts, counties, sub-counties, parishes, and villages for your specific needs.
3. Integrate Uganda Data Project data into your applications, research, or analysis.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and started using the Uganda Data Project API. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the [Uganda Data Project API documentation](https://docs.uganda-data-project.com/api) for detailed information.
